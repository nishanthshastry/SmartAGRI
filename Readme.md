## Overview

The application will help the farmers to improve their profit and yield by understanding the yields of different crops in different areas.

Technologies used: -

- Python (many python libraries)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Django(Web framework)
- Google translate API
- Dialogflow (Chatbot)
- Oracle Cloud Platform


## ML Algorithms

* K Nearest Neighbor
* Multi Linear Regression
* The ML Algorithm used is the K-nearest neighbor because it is a classification algorithm, 
  helps us to suggest the type of crop with more yield, with more accuracy than other 
  classification algorithms.

## Unique Features
